# Asylum
## Madeleine Roux
I really love to read horror/thriller books and this is exactly that. Iv'e also been obsessed with the history of insane asylums and this book follows the story of a guy going to college and his dorm is an old asylum. There's ghosts, possession, and so many plot twists I never saw coming; I've re-read this book so many times and it gets better each time. Its also a series but thie first book is the best of the 4, The prequel is the second best.
